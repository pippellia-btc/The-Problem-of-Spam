# The Problem of Spam in Geyser
Decentralising systems, if successful, suffer from spam problems. But what is spam, and more importantly, how to solve it?

## What is Spam?
If you look up the word Spam in a dictionary, what you find is more or less the following
1. _Unsolicited_ e-mail, often of a commercial nature, sent indiscriminately to multiple mailing lists, individuals, or newsgroups;
2. Any _undesired_ electronic content automatically generated.

'_Unsolicited_’, ’_undesired_’, but who judges? Well, obviously the receiver can judge, but he is also the only one who can. What is trash (or spam!) to one is treasure to another.

**Rule 1**. _You cannot judge what spam is for someone else. Not even close
in some cases._

There are online communities that you can consider weird, or excessive, or
transgressive, many would say the same thing about us bitcoiners. In any case,
only the receiver can choose, on a completely personal basis what is spam for
him and what is not.

If someone decided for him _against his will_, that would be called censorship.
There are no half-measures here; just as a little theft does not stop being such,
so a little censorship does not stop being censorship.

## How to Censor Gracefully

How to censor gracefully? First, don’t do it; unless it is completely necessary.
In some cases, it is not a question of censorship, but of creating specific rules of interaction (e.g. character limit on Twitter) or rules that incentivise giving more space to the _Signal_ and less to the _Noise_.

Again, who decides what is Signal and what is Noise? Well, you know who,the receiver! But who is it?
